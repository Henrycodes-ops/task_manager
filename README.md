## Task Manager Web App  
> A neat little tool to handle tasks — built fast when ideas pop up.

---

### What’s This About?  
This is the **Task Manager Web App**, a relaxed project made from scratch. No big plans — when ideas hit, they turn into code, and this is what comes out.  

> *“Why plan when you can just make it?”* — The feeling here.

---

### Features (So Far)  
- **Add Tasks**: Put in what you need to do.  
- **Delete Tasks**: Finished? It’s gone.  
- **Easy Look**: Simple design, no stress.  
*More fun stuff comes when new ideas show up!*

---

### Why It’s Here  
It’s all about taking quick thoughts and making them real — and maybe helpful. Expect some mess, good ideas, and a bit of “oh, that’s nice.”  

> Made from nothing, powered by whatever comes to mind.

---

### How to Run It  
*Details later when things settle!*  
1. `git clone` this thing.  
2. Open it in a browser.  
3. Hope it works (just joking… sort of).

### Want to Help?  
This is an open project, so if you have ideas or fixes:  
- Add an issue.

- Let’s make it better together.

### License
